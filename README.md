# Psychic-Game

I developed this game as part of a school project.  The object of the game is to guess the same letter that the computer chose.  If you correctly guess the computer generated letter, your "wins" will increase by 1, a new letter will be generated by the computer and your "Letters Guessed" will reset.  If you do not guess correctly,  "Guessed Left" will deacrease by one and your "Letters Guessed" will be logged.  Once your "Guesses Left" falls to 0, your "Losses" will increase by 1, and "Letters Guessed" as well as "Guesses Left" will reset.  If you win 5 times you win the game and if you lose 5 times you will lose the game.
